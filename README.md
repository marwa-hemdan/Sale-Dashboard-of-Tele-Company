# 📈 Sales Agent Performance Dashboard Analysis

## 🌟 Project Overview

This repository contains the data, analysis, and assets for a detailed breakdown of sales agent performance, originally structured as an interactive Excel Dashboard.

The goal of this project is to analyze key sales metrics—such as call volume, conversion rates, and total deal value—to evaluate agent effectiveness and identify top performers over a 12-month period.

## 📁 Repository Contents

The repository includes the following files, which were derived from the original Excel workbook:

| Filename | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `excel_dashboard_in_3_steps_dl.xlsx - Data.csv` | The raw, daily-level transactional data for all sales agents, including date, call statistics, and deal values. |
| `excel_dashboard_in_3_steps_dl.xlsx - Dashboard.csv` | The aggregated, agent-by-agent summary data, used to drive the main dashboard visualizations. |
| `excel_dashboard_in_3_steps_dl.xlsx - Analysis.csv` | A time-series summary of key metrics on a monthly basis. |
| `sa1.png` | A screenshot/image of a section of the final dashboard visualization. |
| `sa2.png` | A screenshot/image of another section of the final dashboard visualization. |
